# Blind Shooter
Collaboration with 3 others to build a single player, interactive text-based program that incorporated object-oriented design using Java to create a grid-game where the player has to fight his/her way through hoards of monsters to save his/her own life

I focused primarily on the object-oriented aspect as well as logic corectness within code

Concepts: Object Oriented Programming, Polymorphism, Operator Overloading

Tools: Eclipse, GitHub

Languages: Java
